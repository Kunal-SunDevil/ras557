        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project focuses on the development of a bipedal robot using a 5-bar linkage mechanism. 
            Inspired by the biomechanics of bird locomotion, the robot mimics natural gait walking pattern.

            Using a five-bar linkage system leveraging the foldable mechanism, the biomimicry of an ostrich's legs mimics the intricate, 
            multi-joint motions of real limbs, offering important insights into bipedal biomechanics. This design makes smoother and more flexible 
            motion possible in robotic applications, which captures the kinematics and dynamics of different gaits. Biped biomechanism has been a 
            hot research topic for decades thanks to its adaptability and low energy required to walk and get higher mobility. 
            This project aims to study, develop, and mimic bipedal gait using foldable robotic techniques to further the utility and understanding 
            of the nuances of foldable mechanismsâ€™ structural rigidity and the flexibility of joints and links.

        <h2>Kinematic Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The legs of this robot are designed based on a five-bar linkage mechanism. Because the device is essentially a planar five-bar linkage with one link extended, it has two degrees of freedom. 
            It also has two motors, which drive the upper two angles of the device. Choosing arbitrary length for the links, the kinematics of the mechanism is as shown in the figure below.
            <img src="Simulation Files/kinem.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            Two positional arguements are given to verify the kinematic linkages of the five bar mechanism as shown in the figure below. This validates the mechanism and the effect of input joint angles to the end effector position.
            <img src="Simulation Files/kinem_final.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

    <section id="Mujoco">
        <h2>Simulation study</h2>
        <p>
            Using MuJoCo, the five bar mechanism based bipedal robot was simulated. First, the xml template was created which takes the variables robot support height, joint angles and end effector lengths as input arguements.
            <p> The support height helps in suspending robot at different heights using a prismatic joint (this joint helps the robot to move in one axis) to enable static or dynamic simulation to study the end effector position, this inturn helps in studying the effect of end effector length on the gait trajectory </p>
            <p> The end effector angles is a primary variable that is being optimized as a goal of this project, the xml template takes end effector length as variable and converts accordingly to fit the joint definitions within the xml. </p>
            <p> The simulation setup is as shown in figure below. </p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/simsetup.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <p> Four input angles, two for each leg are to be controlled using motors defined within the xml template. The angles are generated to simulate a walking trajectory as shown in the figure for one leg. These angles are again implemented in the other leg with appropriate phase difference. </p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/motor_input.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <p>Static Simulation:</p>
            <p>First, a static simulation was carried to track the end effector trajectory and gait cycle generated using the input angles. For this, the robot is suspended at a height where feet doesn't touch the floor which disables the robot movement along the axis.
            The static simulation can be viewed below, from the animation, it can be seen that all joints and angles are very well defined.</p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/Static.gif" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <p> The end effector position was stored to plot, visualize and validate with the final robot experimental data. The end effector trajectory during static simulation is as follows: </p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/endeffsim.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

            <p>Dynamic Simulation: </p>
            <p> For this part, the support height was reduced and fixed at a constant height, enough for the feet to touch the floor and enable motion forward. The dynamic simulation can be seen here which shows that the robot's gait is correct and the movement is on.</p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/dynam.gif" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <p>The end effector trajectory of both legs: </p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/endeff_dyn.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

            <p>Optimization: </p>
            <p>The effect of end effector length can now be studied by varying the aforementioned parameter and tracking the end effector position. An arbitrary range was selected to simulate the robot's end effector trajectory
            for different end effector lenghts, the simulation run was defined within a function that iterates the loop accordingly and outputs the end effector trajectory for each and different link lengths.</p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/walktrajs.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
            <p> The distance travelled by the robot in 10 seconds was taken as an objectove function and optimized across the range of link lengths and a peak was identified where robot travels the most with an optimal link length, this can be seen fromt he plot below,</p>
            <img src="Simulation Files/optim.png" alt="hi" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

            <p>Final Dynamic Simulation: </p>
            <p>Using the optimized link length, simulation reveals the final dynamic performance of the robot's gait cycle for 10 seconds..</p>

        <h2>Manufacturing Planning</h2>
    
        <!-- Design Process -->
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
            The bipedal robot features a modular design architecture that can be broken down into three primary components: the main body structure, the five-bar leg mechanism, and the end-effector knee, each fabricated independently to ensure precision and ease of modification. 
            This modular approach was specifically engineered to facilitate comprehensive research on end-effector length effects. 
            The legs were designed with quick-release mechanisms that seamlessly interface with the primary five-bar mechanism, while the motors remain securely mounted to the robot's structural plane.
        </p>
    
        <p>This thoughtful design architecture offers several significant advantages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Experimental flexibility:</strong> The modular components allow researchers to swap different leg configurations while maintaining consistent motor positioning and control parameters, enabling precise comparative analysis of end-effector performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mechanical stability:</strong> The strategic mounting of motors directly to the structural plane minimizes unwanted vibrations and ensures precise control over leg movements, regardless of end-effector length variations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Systematic data collection:</strong> The ability to rapidly interchange leg lengths while keeping other variables constant facilitates methodical investigation of how end-effector length influences critical performance metrics, including energy efficiency, gait stability, and dynamic response.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Design optimization:</strong> Independent fabrication of each component not only simplifies maintenance and replacement but also enables iterative testing of various configurations to determine optimal setups for specific locomotion tasks or environmental conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assembly efficiency:</strong> The separation of components into distinct modules streamlines both the initial assembly process and subsequent modifications, reducing downtime between experimental trials and facilitating rapid prototyping of new design iterations.
            </li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
            A few dimensions were chosen for the five-bar mechanism as seen in the figure below:
        </p>
        <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
            <img src="dxf_files/LegFiveBarDimensions.png" alt="Five-Bar Dimensions" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
        </div>
    
        <p>
            The legs were subsequently integrated with the body layer through a precise mounting process. This central structural layer serves as the foundation, with servo motors securely fastened to provide controlled actuation. 
            The legs were strategically positioned and mounted on opposite sides of the body, ensuring balanced weight distribution and optimal mechanical advantage for the robot's movements. 
            This configuration can be observed in detail in the illustration below:

                <p>
                    For the initial prototype fabrication, a precise five-layer laminate structure was designed to achieve optimal mechanical properties. The structure begins with a rigid cardstock base layer that provides fundamental structural support, followed by an adhesive layer ensuring secure bonding.
                    The critical middle layer consists of a thin plastic film, specifically engineered for creating flexible joints within the mechanism. This flexible layer is then secured by a second adhesive layer, and the structure is completed with another cardstock layer, forming a symmetrical and robust sandwich configuration.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This carefully engineered layering system creates a balance between structural integrity and controlled flexibility, where the outer cardstock layers provide rigidity while the central plastic film enables precise joint movement at designated locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the established manufacturing workflow, each layer is modified with simple plain hinges at joint locations to facilitate interconnection between different body segments. The individual layer designs are illustrated below:

            Following successful laminate fabrication, the completed structure appears as shown below:
        </p>

            <img src="dxf_files/rev1.0/Figures/FinalCutLaminates.png" alt="Final Laminate" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
        </div>
    
        <p>
            The assembly process of the robot begins with integrating the fabricated laminate structures into a functional mechanism. 
            The body laminate serves as the central mounting platform, where servo adapters are securely fastened using nuts and bolts at precisely designated locations shown in the previous illustration.
        </p>
        <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
            <img src="dxf_files/rev1.0/Figures/ServoMount.png" alt="Servo Mount" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Snap connectors are strategically positioned and attached at specific points on the body laminate, creating secure attachment points that facilitate the integration of the five-bar mechanism and leg components with the main body. 
            These snap connectors are essential as they allow for both robust mechanical connection and easy disassembly when needed, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the robot design.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final assembled robot looks something like this

        <h4>Bipedal Robot rev 2.0</h4>
    
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: stretch;">
            <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
                <p>
                    Initial testing of the cardstock-based robot prototype revealed significant structural limitations that impacted its performance. The joints and links exhibited vulnerability to failure during operation, and the structure lacked sufficient rigidity to maintain stable positioning. Most notably, the robot body demonstrated undesirable flexing during servo motor actuation, compromising precise control and movement accuracy.
                    To address these structural deficiencies, we implemented a comprehensive material upgrade by transitioning to a more robust five-layer fiberglass laminate design.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
                <img src="dxf_files/rev2.0/Figures/LaminateStructure.png" alt="Laminate Structure" style="max-width: 100%; height: 80%; max-height: 350px;" />
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            This enhanced material composition delivered substantial improvements in mechanical performance, providing superior rigidity and enabling the robot to maintain stable positioning with improved self-supporting capabilities.
            However, this material transition presented both advantages and challenges. While the fiberglass structure significantly enhanced the robot's rigidity and structural integrity, it also introduced several trade-offs. The overall weight of the robot increased notably due to the denser material composition. The original snap connector system had to be replaced with a more robust nut-and-bolt assembly method to accommodate the increased structural demands while preserving the design's modularity. Additionally, the cost of fabrication increased substantially due to the more expensive materials and complex manufacturing process required for fiberglass laminates.
            This evolution in design represents a careful balance between structural performance and practical considerations, where enhanced mechanical properties were achieved at the expense of increased weight, assembly complexity, and manufacturing cost.   
        </p>    
        <p>
            While maintaining the same design files and fabrication process from the previous version, we optimized the manufacturing approach for efficiency. The five-bar leg mechanism was constructed using the complete five-layer laminate structure, whereas the body was simplified to a two-layer design. The top and bottom layers of the body were individually laser cut and then connected using standoffs, maintaining structural integrity while reducing production time.
            This hybrid approach preserved the design's core functionality while streamlining the manufacturing process, effectively balancing structural requirements with fabrication efficiency.

            <p> The speed of prototype is more than half of that of simulation from the figure, this is because of multiple reasons which include low friction, low speed of servo motors and not ideal support mechanism.

        <h2>Discussions</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Mujoco Simulation Assumptions</h3>

            <h4>Implementation Overview</h4>
            <p>
                The simulation uses MuJoCo's physics engine to model a bipedal robot with a five-bar mechanism. The XML template defines a support structure with a prismatic joint and two five-bar mechanisms (one per leg) with four actuated joints. End-effector tracking is implemented through spherical markers for precise motion analysis.
            </p>

            <h4>Control System</h4>
            <p>
                The walking gait is generated using a sinusoidal control pattern operating at 1 Hz with a quarter-cycle phase difference between legs. Walking gait amplitudes are set at 20 degrees, with base angles at 70 and -60 degrees for respective motors, creating a balanced walking pattern.
            </p>

            <h4>Key Assumptions</h4>
            <p>The simulation makes several simplifications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectly rigid bodies instead of flexible materials</li>
                <li>Basic damping for joint dynamics</li>
                <li>Simplified friction coefficients</li>
                <li>Idealized support structure without friction</li>
                <li>Perfect motor responses without delays</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-World Differences</h4>
            <p>Physical implementation differs from simulation in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fiberglass structure exhibits flexibility</li>
                <li>Complex joint friction and backlash effects</li>
                <li>Variable surface interactions</li>
                <li>Motor limitations and response delays</li>
                <li>Control system latencies</li>
                <li>Support structure dynamics</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Expected Performance</h4>
            <p>Real-world performance will likely show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower operational speed due to mechanical losses</li>
                <li>Increased movement variation</li>
                <li>Higher energy requirements</li>
                <li>Greater end-effector position error</li>
                <li>Need for control system tuning</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The simulation provides valuable design insights while acknowledging these practical limitations.</p>

        <h3>2. Design Variable Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Our primary design variable was the end-effector length of the five-bar mechanism. This choice was strategically motivated by several factors. First, the end-effector length directly influences the robot's gait trajectory and walking efficiency. Second, it represents a parameter that could be readily modified in both simulation and physical prototype, making it ideal for comparative analysis. Third, this variable significantly impacts the robot's overall performance without requiring fundamental changes to the core mechanism design.
            </p>
        
            <h3>3. Optimization Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                We employed a systematic global parameter sweep approach to understand how end-effector length affects robot performance. The simulation framework used MuJoCo to test end-effector lengths across a predetermined range, measuring the distance traveled by the robot over a fixed 10-second period.
            </p>
            
            <p>This approach was chosen for several key advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It provided a clear, quantifiable metric (distance traveled) that directly correlates with walking efficiency</li>
                <li>The 10-second timeframe offered sufficient duration to observe stable walking patterns while maintaining computational efficiency</li>
                <li>The parameter sweep allowed us to identify not just local optima but understand the broader relationship between end-effector length and performance</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>4. Results Analysis and Physical Correlation</h3>
            <p>
                The simulation results aligned with physical expectations in several key aspects. The optimal end-effector length identified through simulation demonstrated improved walking efficiency in the physical prototype, validating our modeling approach. This correlation can be attributed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The accurate representation of the five-bar mechanism's kinematics in our simulation model</li>
                <li>Careful consideration of physical constraints and joint limitations</li>
                <li>The implementation of realistic motor torque limits and friction coefficients</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                However, we observed that the physical prototype achieved approximately 50% of the simulated speed, indicating some divergence between model and reality.
            </p>
        
        <h3>5. Sources of Error and Sim-to-Real Gap</h3>
        
            <h4>Material Properties</h4>
            <p>
                The simulation assumed ideal rigid bodies, while our physical prototype exhibited some flexibility in the fiberglass structure. Additionally, joint friction and damping effects were simplified in the simulation model.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Environmental Factors</h4>
            <p>
                Surface contact modeling in simulation didn't fully capture the complex friction interactions present in the real world. The support mechanism in the physical prototype introduced additional dynamics not present in the simulation.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Actuation Differences</h4>
            <p>
                Servo motor response characteristics and delays weren't fully captured in the simulation. The simulation assumed perfect torque control, while physical servos have inherent limitations.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Recommendations for Closing Sim-to-Real Gap</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing more sophisticated contact models in simulation</li>
                <li>Including detailed servo motor dynamics in the simulation model</li>
                <li>Developing better system identification methods for material properties</li>
                <li>Incorporating compliance modeling for the fiberglass structure</li>
            </ul>
    
        <h3>6. Version 2.0 Recommendations</h3>
        
            <h4>Structural Enhancements</h4>

            </ul>
        
            <h4>Control System Updates</h4>

        <h2>Discussions</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Jupyter Notebook Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            The notebook implements a MuJoCo simulation of our bipedal robot using an XML template defining the five-bar mechanism structure. The robot model includes a support beam with a prismatic joint and four actuated joints for the legs. We simplified the model by assuming perfectly rigid bodies, basic damping in joints, and idealized friction coefficients. The control system uses a 1 Hz sinusoidal pattern with quarter-cycle phase differences between legs, operating at 20-degree amplitudes with base angles of 70/-60 degrees. These simplifications differ from real-world conditions where material flexibility, complex friction patterns, and motor response limitations significantly affect performance.
        </p>
    
        <h3>2. Design Variable Selection</h3>
        <p>
            We chose to optimize the end-effector length as our primary design variable because it directly influences gait trajectory and walking efficiency. This parameter could be readily modified in both simulation and physical prototype without requiring fundamental changes to the core mechanism design, making it ideal for comparative analysis and practical implementation.
        </p>
    
        <h3>3. Optimization Approach</h3>
        <p>
            Our optimization employed a global parameter sweep across various end-effector lengths, measuring distance traveled over 10-second trials. This approach was selected because it provided a clear, quantifiable metric for walking efficiency while allowing sufficient time to observe stable gait patterns. The comprehensive sweep helped identify not just local optima but revealed the broader relationship between end-effector length and overall performance.
        </p>
    
        <h3>4. Results Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The physical prototype achieved approximately 50% of the simulated speed with the optimized end-effector length. This alignment validates our basic modeling approach while highlighting expected real-world limitations. The reduced performance primarily stems from material flexibility, joint friction, and motor response characteristics not fully captured in the simulation model.
        </p>
    
        <h3>5. Error Sources and Improvements</h3>
        <p>
            Leading error sources include material flexibility in the fiberglass structure, complex joint friction patterns, and servo motor limitations. To close the sim-to-real gap, we recommend implementing more sophisticated contact models, incorporating detailed motor dynamics in simulation, and developing better system identification methods for material properties. Adding compliance modeling for the fiberglass structure would also improve simulation accuracy.
        </p>
    
        <h3>6. Version 2.0 Development</h3>
        <p>
            For the next iteration, we propose developing a hybrid material system balancing rigidity and weight, implementing closed-loop feedback control with position sensors, and adding force and IMU sensors for improved stability analysis. The design would feature a more compact body, quick-change mechanisms for testing, and enhanced data logging capabilities. These improvements would address current limitations while expanding research capabilities.
